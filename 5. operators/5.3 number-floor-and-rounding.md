<h1>Flooring a Number</h1>
<p>You can floor a number or remove all decimal places using the int() function which converts a floating point number (with decimal places) into an integer (whole number).</p>

<code>
int(3.738492) # Becomes 3
</code>

<h1>Rounding a Number</h1>
<p>However, if you want to round a decimal number to the nearest whole number using the traditional mathematical way, where anything over .5 rounds up and anything below rounds down. Then you can use the python round() function.</p>
<code>
round(3.738492) # Becomes 4

round(3.14159)  # Becomes 3

round(3.14159, 2) # Becomes 3.14
</code>
